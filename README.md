# StepTalk Scripting Framework

StepTalk is amazing scripting framework created by Stefan Urbanek. [orignal README](https://github.com/onflapp/libs-steptalk/blob/master/README)

I forked it to fix some issues that prevented it from working properly and enhance it 
to make it work well as the main scripting environment for [GNUstep Desktop](https://github.com/onflapp/gs-desktop).
